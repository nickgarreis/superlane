# #141415 to #141414 Update

**Date:** 11-02-2026 10:01

## Summary
Replaced editable `#141415` color usages with `#141414`.

## Changes
- Updated `#141415` to `#141414` in:
  - `src/app/components/BrandAssets.tsx`
  - `src/app/components/main-content/FileSection.tsx`

## Validation
- Confirmed updated usages now read `#141414` in editable app files.
- `#141415` still appears in `src/imports/Main.tsx` and `src/imports/Redesign.tsx`, which were intentionally not edited because `src/imports/` is auto-generated and should not be manually modified.
