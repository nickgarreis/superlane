# Root Production Remediation Plan

## Summary
Created a prioritized production remediation plan in the project root:

- `/Users/nick/Designagency/PRODUCTION_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`

## What the plan contains
- Priority tiers (`P0` to `P3`)
- Concrete workstreams and implementation steps
- "Done when" acceptance criteria per workstream
- Recommended execution sequence
- Final production-readiness exit criteria

## Intent
Provide an implementation-ready roadmap to complete the migration from a prototype/hybrid state to a production-ready application with full backend capability and hardened auth/security operations.
