# WorkOS linked logins problem statement file

## Date
- 13-02-2026 11:41

## Goal
- Create a root-level markdown file documenting the current linked-logins issue, preserving user assumptions and linking prior implementation docs.

## What changed
- Added `/Users/nick/Designagency/workos-linked-logins-problem.md` with:
  - user assertion that methods should be synced because auth resolves to the same app account,
  - expected vs observed behavior,
  - likely failure boundary (sync freshness/persistence),
  - concrete verification checklist,
  - links to related docs in `docs/`.

## Linked docs referenced
- `/Users/nick/Designagency/docs/13-02-2026_11-12_workos-linked-logins-plan-file.md`
- `/Users/nick/Designagency/docs/13-02-2026_11-24_workos-linked-logins-implementation.md`
- `/Users/nick/Designagency/docs/13-02-2026_11-33_accounttab-component-split.md`

## Validation
- Documentation-only update; no runtime command required.
